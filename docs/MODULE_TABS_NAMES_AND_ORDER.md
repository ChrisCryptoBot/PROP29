# Module Tab Names and Order — Standard

**Logic:** Overview → Core workflow → Supporting → Reference / config → **Settings** last.  
**Naming:** One term for summary tab (**Overview**); one for config (**Settings**); consistent labels (e.g. **Analytics** not "Analytics & Reports" / "Reports & Analytics").
