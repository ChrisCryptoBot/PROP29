The MVP is targeted for Q4 2025 (around week 78), with Phases 1-4 covering MVP feature development, Phase 5 including QA for MVP, and an implicit MVP deployment at the end of Phase 5 or early Phase 6, followed by advanced feature refinement.

Phase Structure: The six phases follow the template’s structure, with durations scaled to the project’s complexity (12, 24, 20, 20, 16, 12 weeks). Phase 4 includes both MVP integrations (e.g., PMS, access control) and advanced features (e.g., IoT, cybersecurity) to fit the template while addressing all requirements.

Task Specificity: Tasks are detailed with technologies (e.g., AWS, PostgreSQL, React) and features (e.g., incident management, AI analytics) specific to PROPER 2.9, ensuring clarity and relevance.

Risk and Resources: Risks, contingencies, and resource allocations are customized to reflect the project’s technical challenges (e.g., AI accuracy, hardware delays) and team composition.

This completed file serves as a comprehensive blueprint for the PROPER 2.9 project, ready for use and further customization as development progresses.
