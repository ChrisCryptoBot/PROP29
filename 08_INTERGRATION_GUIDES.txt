# Integration Guides for PROPER 2.9 AI-Enhanced Hotel Security Platform

This document provides detailed guides for integrating the PROPER 2.9 platform with various third-party systems, hardware, and services. These integrations are crucial for the platform's functionality, enabling seamless connectivity with property management systems, access control devices, IoT sensors, and more.

Each integration guide includes environment-specific configurations to ensure proper setup across development, testing, staging, and production environments.

## Supported Integrations

The following integrations are supported by the PROPER 2.9 platform:

1. **Property Management System (PMS) Integration**
2. **Access Control System Integration**
3. **IoT Sensor Integration**
4. **Video Management System Integration**
5. **Emergency Services Integration**
6. **Cybersecurity Tool Integration**

Each section below provides specific instructions for setting up and configuring each integration, with notes on how configurations differ across environments.

## 1. Property Management System (PMS) Integration

### Overview

The PMS integration allows the PROPER 2.9 platform to synchronize data with hotel property management systems, such as guest information, room assignments, and reservation details. This integration is essential for features like guest safety and access control.

### Prerequisites

- Access to a supported PMS (e.g., Opera, Amadeus)
- API credentials or access tokens for the PMS, specific to each environment
- Network connectivity between the PROPER 2.9 platform and the PMS

### Configuration

The configuration varies depending on the environment:

- **Development**: Use a mock PMS or a test instance provided by the PMS vendor. For example, Opera might offer a sandbox environment for testing.

- **Testing**: Use a staging or test environment of the PMS, which should mimic the production environment as closely as possible.

- **Staging**: Connect to the staging environment of the PMS, which is typically used for pre-production testing.

- **Production**: Connect to the live production environment of the PMS, using production API credentials.

Steps to configure:

1. **Identify Supported PMS**: Confirm that your PMS is supported by PROPER 2.9. Currently, supported systems include Opera, Amadeus, and others.

2. **Obtain API Credentials**: From your PMS provider, obtain the necessary API keys, tokens, or credentials required for integration. Ensure you have the correct credentials for the respective environment (dev, test, stage, prod).

3. **Configure Integration Service**: In the PROPER 2.9 platform, navigate to the Integration Service settings. Select "PMS Integration" and choose your PMS vendor from the list.

4. **Enter Credentials**: Input the API credentials provided by your PMS for the current environment.

5. **Set Up Data Mapping**: Configure how data from the PMS should be mapped to the PROPER 2.9 platform. For example, map guest IDs, room numbers, etc. This mapping should be consistent across environments, but ensure that test data is used in non-production environments.

6. **Test Connection**: Verify the integration by testing the connection to the PMS. Ensure that data can be successfully exchanged. In development and testing environments, use test data to avoid affecting live operations.

### API Documentation

The PMS integration uses the following API endpoints, which may vary by environment:

- `GET /pms/guests`: Retrieve guest information

- `GET /pms/rooms`: Retrieve room assignments

- `POST /pms/reservations`: Create or update reservations

( Note: Actual API endpoints may vary based on the PMS vendor and environment. )

### Troubleshooting

- **Connection Errors**: Check network connectivity and ensure that firewall rules allow communication between the platforms. In production, ensure that the network is secure and that there are no restrictions blocking the connection.

- **Authentication Issues**: Verify that the API credentials are correct and not expired for the current environment.

- **Data Mapping Errors**: Ensure that the data fields are correctly mapped between the two systems. In non-production environments, use test data to verify mappings.

### Examples

For Opera PMS in production, the configuration might look like this:

```json
{
  "pms_vendor": "opera",
  "api_url": "[invalid url, do not cite]
  "api_key": "your_production_api_key",

Integration Checklist
To ensure successful integration across all environments, follow this checklist for each integration:
Pre-Implementation:
Verify environment-specific prerequisites (e.g., API keys for production, mock services for development).

Confirm network connectivity and firewall settings for the target environment.

Set up environment variables in .env files as per the configuration examples.

Install necessary dependencies or SDKs for the integration.

Review compliance requirements, especially for production (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

Implementation:
Configure the Integration Service with environment-specific settings.

Implement data mapping and rules tailored to the environment (e.g., synthetic data in testing).

Set up monitoring and logging to capture integration events, using tools like Datadog in production.

Test API endpoints or hardware connections in the target environment.

Document any environment-specific deviations or customizations.

Testing:
Run unit tests for API integrations in development and testing environments.

Perform integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality, using mock data in non-production environments.

Simulate error scenarios (e.g., network failures, invalid credentials) to ensure robust error handling.

Validate performance metrics, such as response times, in staging and production.

Conduct security tests, especially in production, to ensure compliance with standards like SOC 2 and ISO 27001.

Deployment:
Deploy integration configurations to the target environment using CI/CD pipelines.

Verify production credentials and secure storage (e.g., AWS Parameter Store, Vault).

Enable monitoring and alerting for integration health in production (e.g., Datadog, CloudWatch).

Update documentation with environment-specific details and troubleshooting steps.

Train operations teams on monitoring and managing integrations in production.

Troubleshooting Common Issues Across Environments
Development Environment:
Issue: Mock services not responding.
Solution: Ensure mock server is running (e.g., local MQTT broker for IoT sensors) and check configuration URLs.

Issue: Data inconsistencies in tests.
Solution: Reset synthetic data between tests to avoid state conflicts.

Testing Environment:
Issue: Test hardware unavailable.
Solution: Use simulated hardware or request test instances from vendors (e.g., HID test controllers).

Issue: Integration tests failing due to timeouts.
Solution: Adjust timeout settings in test configurations or optimize test data volume.

Staging Environment:
Issue: Partial data availability.
Solution: Ensure anonymized PII is correctly populated and mapped in staging PMS or access control systems.

Issue: Performance degradation.
Solution: Scale staging resources to match production-like conditions and analyze bottlenecks.

Production Environment:
Issue: Live service outages.
Solution: Check vendor status pages (e.g., Splunk, Milestone) and verify network connectivity.

Issue: Compliance violations detected.
Solution: Review audit logs and ensure all data handling complies with GDPR, CCPA, and PCI DSS.
