Security Testing Standards
Testing Strategy: Security-first testing with comprehensive coverage
- Security Tests: 100% coverage for authentication, authorization, data protection
- Unit Tests: 95%+ coverage with security scenario testing
- Integration Tests: All API endpoints with security validation
- Penetration Tests: Quarterly external testing, continuous internal testing
